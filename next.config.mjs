  // The netlify.toml [[headers]] block only applies to files the CDN serves
  // directly. Everything rendered by a function — the entire dashboard and all
  // 253 API routes — was getting none of it. So the dashboard was framable
  // despite frame-ancestors 'none' being written down, and the stored-HTML
  // fields in Marketing Hub had no CSP behind them at all. Reading the config
  // gave the opposite impression, which is why this is recorded here.
  //
  // next.config headers go through the framework, so they apply to SSR
  // responses too. netlify.toml keeps its copy for static assets; the two
  // should be changed together.
  //
  // script-src still carries 'unsafe-inline' because app/layout.tsx has an
  // inline theme bootstrap and ~10 components inject <style> blocks. Removing
  // it needs a nonce on each, which is worth doing — but a CSP that is actually
  // delivered and slightly loose beats a strict one that never arrives.
