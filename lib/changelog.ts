// What changed in the dashboard, written for the team.

// Hand-written on purpose. A changelog generated from commit messages reads like
// engineering notes — it tells you a function was renamed, not that the button you
// press every morning now goes somewhere different. Every entry here says what it is
// now and, where it helps, what it was before, because "what was there and what was
// changed" is the whole point.
//
// Adding a release: put a new object at the TOP of RELEASES. Keep `what` to one
// sentence someone outside this file would understand, and use `before` only when the
// change is confusing without it.
