// The Radar's "Google Reviews" tile sat dim and said "not connected" for months, and the
// assumption was that connecting it needed a Google Places API key and a billing account.
// It doesn't: Serper (already keyed, already paying for the Reddit/Quora lanes) returns
// both the business card and the review text, so this needed no new credential at all.
//
// Two reasons reviews belong on a Content Radar, and they pull in opposite directions:
//   - A bad review is reputation damage that is costing money while nobody answers it.
//     Those are urgent and there are few of them.
//   - A good review is a testimonial you could post. There are hundreds and they are
//     interchangeable, so showing them all would bury everything else on the page.
// That asymmetry is why the two are ranked and labelled differently below rather than
// poured into one list of "reviews".

// should be a config change rather than a code change.
