// The SBU (brand / business unit) list, in one place.
//
// SBU is a required field on every task — the create gate in
// /api/marketing-hub/create rejects a row without one, because a brand-less row
// can't be routed, filtered or reported on by anybody. Three surfaces used to keep
// their own drifting copies of this list; they all read this now.
//
// Live facets from the hub API take precedence wherever they're available — this
// is the fallback, and the option list for surfaces that don't load facets.
