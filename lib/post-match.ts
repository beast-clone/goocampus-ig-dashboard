// Matching a Content Calendar task to the post that actually went live.
//
// Why this exists: the dashboard already has a write-back seam (lib/mh-linkback)
// that fills a task's Instagram / Facebook / LinkedIn link the moment IT publishes
// something. The team publishes from the apps instead, so that seam has never
// fired — on 27 Sep 2026 all 41 published tasks had no link at all. This works the
// other way round: take the posts that are genuinely live (the same /api/posts feed
// the Publishing Calendar draws) and work out which task each one belongs to.
//
// The rule is deliberately cautious. A wrong link is worse than a blank one: it
// looks right, so nobody checks it. Everything here is built so the caller can tell
// "this is certainly the post" apart from "one of these is the post" — see
// `confident` on the result.
