// OFF since 8 October 2026. Tasks are created in the dashboard now.
//
// Airtable was where work was written, and this pulled it across every hour. That
// made Airtable the authority on things it could not actually know — above all who
// is doing a job, because claiming only exists here. Any edit to an Airtable row
// made it "newer" and handed a claimed task back to whoever wrote the brief,
// silently. It happened to eight tasks over three weeks before anyone traced it.
//
// Having two systems disagree about the same task is the problem; arbitrating
// between them is only a patch. So the automatic pull stops and the dashboard
// becomes the one place a task is born. lib/airtable-import.ts keeps its claim
// protection regardless — if this is ever switched back on, that rule still holds.
//
// Switching it back on is an env var, not a deploy: set AIRTABLE_IMPORT=on.
// The "Sync from Airtable" button in the Marketing Hub is untouched — that is
// somebody deliberately pulling, not a surprise at the top of the hour.
//
// Hourly sync from Airtable's Content Calendar into the master sheet.
//
//   GET /api/cron/import-airtable
//   Header: x-cron-secret: <CRON_SECRET>
//
// Fired by netlify/functions/import-airtable-cron.mts. The Sync button in the
// Marketing Hub runs the same newest-wins import; this is the unattended version.
//
// It adds new tasks and updates existing ones only where Airtable holds the newer
// change (newestWins — see lib/airtable-import.ts). It used to only add (newOnly),
// so a task published in Airtable never updated here; a plain overwrite would undo
// the team's own edits. Newest-wins does neither.
//
// No date range: the Airtable view (IMPORT_VIEW, "Task Dashboard") already decides
// what is in scope, and it is small. Records that were deleted in the dashboard stay
// deleted — the importer skips anything in the recycle bin.
