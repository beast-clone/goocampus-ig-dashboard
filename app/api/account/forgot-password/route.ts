// The way back in for someone who has forgotten their password. Until this
// existed there was none: the shared team password was removed on 4 Oct so every
// account needs its own, and the only recovery routes left were Google sign-in
// (which does not work outside production) or an admin running
// scripts/set-password.ts. Anyone else was simply locked out.
//
// It emails a 6-digit code and stops there. The second half — code plus new
// password — is already built and public at /api/account/accept-invite, and this
// writes the code in exactly the shape that route reads, so there is one
// verification path rather than two that can drift apart.
//
// Shorter-lived than an invite: a reset is something you asked for seconds ago,
// where a new joiner may not open their email until tomorrow. accept-invite
// honours whatever expiresAt it finds, so the same key carries both.
//
// It answers the same way whether or not the address is on the roster. The
// login route goes to some length to avoid confirming which addresses are real;
// an endpoint that said "no such account" would hand that back, and this one
// needs no session at all.
